AppCompatFragmentListActivity
============================

ListActivity for the Support Library and AppCompat.
This simple library contains two classes: ActionBarListActivity and FragmentListActivity.
To use them, just import this library into Eclipse. 

###Usage:###

Without AppCompat:
```java
import android.support.v4.app.FragmentListActivity;
...
public class Foo extends FragmentListActivity {
```

With AppCompat:
```java
import android.support.v7.app.ActionBarListActivity;
...
public class Bar extends ActionBarListActivity {
```
Note: If you want to use `onContentChanged()` on this one, replace it with `onSupportContentChanged()`. This only applies to ActionBarListActivity (and ActionBarActivity).

#####Goes good with other AppCompat/SupportLib extensions, especially [android-support-v4-preferencefragment](https://github.com/kolavar/android-support-v4-preferencefragment)
